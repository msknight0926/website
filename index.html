  <h1>Welcome to my portfolio!</h1>

  
  <p>Hi my name is Montana Knight, I am a senior at Florida Gulf Coast University pursuing a degree in Biotechnology with a minor in Chemistry. Following graduation I plan on obtaining a Masters degree in Bioinformatics and then finding a job in the industrial sector. This website serves as my portfolio. Here you can find awards, accomplishments, courses taken, and more. I'm always working on it, but I'm pretty happy with what I've been able to do with it so far!</p>
